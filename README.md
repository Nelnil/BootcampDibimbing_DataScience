# BootcampDibimbing_DataScience
Hello! I'm Nail Ghazali, a participant in the Data Science Bootcamp - Digital Skill Fair 39, organized by dibimbing.id.
As part of my learning journey, I conducted EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on the Mental Health in Tech Survey dataset, which provides insights into mental health conditions among employees in the tech industry.

🔍 In this project, I worked on:
- Identifying and handling missing values
- Removing duplicate entries
- Visualizing key data points to uncover trends
- Utilizing Python tools such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn

The goal of this project was to analyze data patterns such as treatment rates, age group trends, and awareness of mental health resources in the workplace.

This project helped me deepen my understanding of data analytics while building my first portfolio project. I’m thankful to be part of a supportive community and to gain hands-on experience guided by mentors.

📌 Preview of my project is available in this repository.
📎 Full notebook and presentation are included
